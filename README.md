## Introduction

The project entails the development of a RESTful API using the Express.js framework, establishing a connection to a PostgreSQL database hosted on a server (Guja server) accessible through port forwarding with the k9s tool. This API will offer various endpoints facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

The initial phase involves establishing a connection to the database and configuring the required database schema, leveraging the predefined PostgreSQL database.

Following this, the project proceeds to craft RESTful API routes using Express.js, tailoring the endpoints to handle CRUD operations and meet specific requirements. Ensuring robust error handling is imperative throughout this process.

To guarantee the API's reliability, the project incorporates unit tests for each endpoint. Testing tools like Jest or Mocha are employed to create and execute these tests. Additionally, a Postman collection is crafted to offer a user-friendly interface for testing the API.

In summary, the project encompasses the construction of a robust and secure RESTful API using Express.js, connecting to a PostgreSQL database via port forwarding with k9s, implementing unit tests, and creating a Postman collection. This integrated approach ensures the development of a reliable API for use by other developers.
